 * @param string $placement The resource name of the search engine placement, such as

 *                          This field is used to identify the set of models that will be used to make
 *                          the search.
 *
 *                          We currently support one placement with the following ID:
 *
 *                          * `default_search`.
 * @param string $visitorId A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this
 *                          could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely
 *                          identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not
 *                          change if the visitor logs in or out of the website.
 *
 *                          The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128
 *                          characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
