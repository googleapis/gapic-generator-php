     *
     *                             The allowed values are:
     *
     *                             * projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., "projects/foo-bar")

     *                             * `labels.env:prod` to find Cloud resources that have a label "env"
     *                             and its value is "prod".
     *                             * `labels.env:*` to find Cloud resources that have a label "env".
     *                             * `kmsKey:key` to find Cloud resources encrypted with a customer-managed
     *                             encryption key whose name contains the word "key".

     *                             * `createTime<1609459200` to find Cloud resources that were created before
     *                             "2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC". 1609459200 is the epoch timestamp of

     *                             * `Important location:(us-west1 OR global)` to find Cloud
     *                             resources that contain "Important" as a word in any of the searchable
     *                             fields and are also located in the "us-west1" region or the "global"
     *                             location.
     * @param string[] $assetTypes Optional. A list of asset types that this request searches for. If empty, it will
     *                             search all the [searchable asset
     *                             types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types).
     *
     *                             Regular expressions are also supported. For example:
     *
     *                             * "compute.googleapis.com.*" snapshots resources whose asset type starts
     *                             with "compute.googleapis.com".
     *                             * ".*Instance" snapshots resources whose asset type ends with "Instance".
     *                             * ".*Instance.*" snapshots resources whose asset type contains "Instance".
     *
     *                             See [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported
     *                             regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any
     *                             supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
