     * @param string[] $resourceNames  Required. Names of one or more parent resources from which to
     *                                 retrieve log entries:
     *
     *                                 "projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
     *                                 "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
     *                                 "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]"
     *                                 "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
     *
     *                                 May alternatively be one or more views
     *                                 projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *                                 organization/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *                                 billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *                                 folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *
     *                                 Projects listed in the `project_ids` field are added to this list. Please see
     *                                 {@see LoggingServiceV2Client::projectName()} for help formatting this field.
     * @param string   $filter         Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return.  See [Advanced
     *                                 Logs Queries](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries).
     *                                 Only log entries that match the filter are returned.  An empty filter
     *                                 matches all log entries in the resources listed in `resource_names`.
     *                                 Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in `resource_names` will
     *                                 cause the filter to return no results. The maximum length of the filter is
     *                                 20000 characters.
     * @param string   $orderBy        Optional. How the results should be sorted.  Presently, the only permitted
     *                                 values are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first
     *                                 option returns entries in order of increasing values of
     *                                 `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option returns entries
     *                                 in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first).  Entries with equal
     *                                 timestamps are returned in order of their `insert_id` values.
     * @param mixed    $optionalFields {
     *     Optional.
     *
     *     @type int $pageSize
     *           Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request.
     *           Default is 50. If the value is negative or exceeds 1000,
     *           the request is rejected. The presence of `next_page_token` in the
     *           response indicates that more results might be available.
     *     @type string $pageToken
     *           Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the
     *           preceding call to this method.  `page_token` must be the value of
     *           `next_page_token` from the previous response.  The values of other method
     *           parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
     * }
