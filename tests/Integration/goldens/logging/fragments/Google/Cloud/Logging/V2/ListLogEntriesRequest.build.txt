     * @param string[] $resourceNames Required. Names of one or more parent resources from which to
     *                                retrieve log entries:
     *
     *                                "projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
     *                                "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
     *                                "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]"
     *                                "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
     *
     *                                May alternatively be one or more views
     *                                projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *                                organization/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *                                billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *                                folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
     *
     *                                Projects listed in the `project_ids` field are added to this list. Please see
     *                                {@see LoggingServiceV2Client::projectName()} for help formatting this field.
     * @param string   $filter        Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return.  See [Advanced
     *                                Logs Queries](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries).
     *                                Only log entries that match the filter are returned.  An empty filter
     *                                matches all log entries in the resources listed in `resource_names`.
     *                                Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in `resource_names` will
     *                                cause the filter to return no results. The maximum length of the filter is
     *                                20000 characters.
     * @param string   $orderBy       Optional. How the results should be sorted.  Presently, the only permitted
     *                                values are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first
     *                                option returns entries in order of increasing values of
     *                                `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option returns entries
     *                                in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first).  Entries with equal
     *                                timestamps are returned in order of their `insert_id` values.
