     * @param string $parent         Required. The parent resource whose buckets are to be listed:

     *                               "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]"

     *                               "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]"
     *
     *                               Note: The locations portion of the resource must be specified, but
     *                               supplying the character `-` in place of [LOCATION_ID] will return all
     *                               buckets. Please see
     *                               {@see ConfigServiceV2Client::organizationLocationName()} for help formatting this field.

     *     Optional.
     *
     *     @type string $pageToken
     *           Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the
     *           preceding call to this method. `pageToken` must be the value of
     *           `nextPageToken` from the previous response. The values of other method
     *           parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
     *     @type int $pageSize
     *           Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request.
     *           Non-positive values are ignored. The presence of `nextPageToken` in the
     *           response indicates that more results might be available.
